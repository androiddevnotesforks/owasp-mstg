Ensure that the app hides sensitive content, such as credit card details and passcodes, from screen readers to protect user privacy.

Additionally, prevent screenshots of sensitive content, as screenshots may be stored in locations accessible to other applications (such as the device's photo gallery, shared storage, or cloud backup services), which could lead to data leakage.
